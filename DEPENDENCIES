  TerraMA2 - Dependencies
  =======================

If you want to build yourself TerraMA2 then you need to install some third-party libraries.

For Microsoft Visual C++ users we have prepared a zip file containing all the third-party libraries in a binary format. You can download this package from:
http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terrama2-devel

In that folder you will find:
  - terrama2-3rdparty-msvc-2013-win64.zip: all the third-party libraries for building a 64-bit version of TerraMA2 with Qt 5.4.1 support.
  - terrama2-3rdparty-msvc-2013-win32.zip: all the third-party libraries for building a 32-bit version of TerraMA2 with Qt 5.4.1 support.

Below is a list of third-party libraries dependencies and its versions.

1. TerraLib (Mandatory)
-----------------------

TerraMA2 is built on top of TerraLib, a free and open source library for building GIS enabled applications.

Make sure to have at least TerraLib version 5.1.0. You can download it from:
http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terralib5


2. Boost (Mandatory)
--------------------

TerraMA2 is built on top of Boost libraries. You will need to have them installed in order to build TerraMA2.

Make sure to have at least version 1.54.0 installed.

If you prefer to install from source, download it from:
http://www.boost.org


2. Qt (Mandatory)
-----------------

Make sure you have an installed Qt version 5.2.1 or later.

Linux users may use any package manager to perform an easy installation.

Mac OS X can use package managers such as Homebrew (http://brew.sh) or MacPorts (http://www.macports.org) in order to have an easy installation.

If you prefer to install from source, download it from:
http://qt-project.org/downloads.

Windows users that had downloaded the auxiliary package (in the TerraMA2 site) must install Qt 5.4.1.
