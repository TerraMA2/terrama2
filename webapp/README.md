TerraMA² Webapp is a free and open source component based web API for use in web geographic information systems (WebGIS).

## Dependencies

In order to use the components of the API, you have to run it. For that to be possible you'll need to install some third-party softwares. It can be found in TerraMA² repository [WEB DEPENDENCIES](https://github.com/TerraMA2/terrama2#web-application-and-components-dependencies) section.

## Execution Instructions

Bellow we show the steps to run TerraMA² Webapp:

- Clone the TerraMA² repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/TerraMA2/terrama2.git
```

Note: This repository contain the entire TerraMA², if you want just the web API, the important is the webapp directory.

- Access the webapp folder and run the following nodejs command:

```bash
cd webapp
npm install # It installs backend web dependencies
bower install # It installs front end dependencies
```

Note: TerraMA2 web application uses NodeJS Sequelize ORM for handling database manipulation. Make sure you have PostgreSQL database and PostGIS spatial extension installed before.

In order to execute, check available contexts names in [config/config.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TerraMA2/terrama2/master/webapp/config/config.terrama2) (Feel free to add a new one following section [Configuration File](#configuration-file)).

After that, run ```npm start ContextName``` where **ContextName** is a key pointing to context credentials. 
Example:

```bash
npm start # it will use default credentials
npm start tests # it will use credentials of tests context
```

Remember that context name is optional. By default, TerraMA² will use ```default``` credentials;

## Configuration File
The TerraMA² Web settings can be found in [config/config.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TerraMA2/terrama2/master/webapp/config/config.terrama2).
