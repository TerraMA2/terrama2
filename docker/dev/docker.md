# Docker
TerraMA2 development docker.

Obs. In this guide I assume you have permission to run `docker` as user, you may also run the commands using `sudo`

## Generate docker image (if you don't have one)

```
docker build -t "terrama2:dev" .
docker run -itd --name terrama2_dev -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v ~/MyDevel:/home/terrama2/devel terrama2:dev
```

The parameter `-v ~/MyDevel:/home/terrama2/devel` at the end of the command is optional but required if you want to have access to the development folder from your host machine.

For consistent permissions, configure your host devel folder with `chmod g+s`.

## Start the docker image

```
docker container start terrama2_dev
```

# Run a software

The environment has these tools already installed:
  - clang-6 (+tools)
  - g++-8
  - gdb/lldb
  - valgrind
  - git

Visual tools:
  - cmake-gui
  - code (VSCode + cpp and cmake extensions)

```
