      \brief The Service provides thread and time management for processes.

      This class is used to manage thread sync and timer listening for derived TerraMA2 services.

      The Service has a main thread that will check for new data to be processed
      and a threadpool that will be allocated to actively process the data.

      ## Threadpool ##

      The number of threads available can be set at the start() of the service or updated later
      by updateNumberOfThreads().

      If the number of threads is set to 0 the service will
      try to identify the concurrency capabilities of the hardware, if this fails
      the number of threads will be set to 1.

      ## Process queue ##

      The processes are placed on a queue during processNextData().
      This method must be overloaded.

      Queued processes will be executed automatically by the threadpool.
